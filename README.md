# Project Gluon

**Rust-based GraphQL gateway with compile-time plugins and schema-first architecture.**

A performant, binary-first GraphQL gateway written in Rust. Gluon features a plugin-based backend integration system with compile-time trait enforcement. Designed for strong schema control, efficient TUI operation, and eventual in-memory caching capabilities. Gluon is the isomorphic counterpart of Graphette, sharing architectural structure but differing in runtime characteristics.
